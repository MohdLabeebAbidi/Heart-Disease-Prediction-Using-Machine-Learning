# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning models. It utilizes various supervised learning techniques to analyze patient data and determine the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health indicators.

## Features
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient
- **Chest Pain Type**: Types of chest pain experienced
- **Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol levels
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Blood sugar levels after fasting
- **ECG Results**: Electrocardiographic results
- **Heart Rate**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exercise Induced Angina**: Whether the patient experienced angina due to exercise
- **ST Depression**: Depression in ST segment
- **Slope of ST Segment**: The slope of the ST segment
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**
- **Thalassemia**: A blood disorder indicator

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following machine learning models have been implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd heart-disease-prediction
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning-checkpoint.ipynb"
```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting heart disease.
